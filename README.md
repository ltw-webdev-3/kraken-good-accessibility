# Kraken good accessibility

## Overview

- _Fork this repository._
- Fix a few accessibility problems:
  1. Add the appropriate ARIA landmark roles to tags in the HTML.
  2. Add proper `aria-label` attributes to the navigation items to make them sound better in VoiceOver; also consider `role="presentation"` to hide unnecessary items from VoiceOver.
  3. Make a few small tweaks to the print styles for better paper accessibility; both in the CSS & HTML with [Modulifier’s print classes](https://learntheweb.courses/topics/modulifier-cheat-sheet/#print-styles).
- _Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks._
